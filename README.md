# Huffman encoding

This project features a GUI-based application for Huffman encoding, which allows users to encrypt input text and files. The application compresses the input using the Huffman encoding algorithm and stores the result as a binary file. Additionally, the program can decrypt the binary files back to their original form. The encryption and decryption processes are implemented using hashmaps for efficient lookup of encoding and decoding values.

Key Features:

GUI Interface: User-friendly interface for inputting text or files.
Huffman Encoding: Compresses data based on frequency of characters.
File Encryption: Stores compressed data in a binary format.
Decryption: Recovers original data from the binary files.
Hashmap-based Implementation: Uses hashmaps to map characters to their binary codes and vice versa, ensuring fast encryption and decryption.
